Icon Requirements
================

This extension needs three icon sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels) - Toolbar icon
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) - Extension management page
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Chrome Web Store

You can create these icons using:
1. Any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.)
2. Online icon generators (favicon.io, etc.)
3. Use the YouTube logo with a "clean" or "check" symbol overlay

Suggested design:
- Red/white color scheme (matching YouTube brand)
- Include a checkmark or broom icon to represent "cleaning"
- Simple, recognizable at small sizes

For now, you can use placeholder icons or skip them during development.
Chrome will show a default icon if these files are missing.
